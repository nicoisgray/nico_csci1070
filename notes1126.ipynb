These tasks include things like learning from experience (machine learning), recognizing patterns (computer vision), understanding language (natural language processing), making decisions, and solving problems. AI systems can range from simple algorithms, like a recommendation system, to complex networks, such as self-driving cars or advanced language models.\" It goes on to explain that AI was made through a series of interconnected scientific breakthroughs, such as Turing's early computers, the increase of computing power, and the invention of rule-based computing systems."

It originated from Turing's machines and as time went on, simple algorithms were made to play games, and in the 80s and 90s, learning algorithms were being created similarly to the ones we have today. Claude then explains that AI is made of algorithms, data training, neural networks, and machine learning techniques."

I also make sure that I double-check every answer it gives me, to make sure I am receiving factual information. "
